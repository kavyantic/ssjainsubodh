                                other essentialities. Subodh has confronted these challenges with its characteristic
                                resilience and courage by seeking opportunities to learn and adapt to the exigencies of
                                the times throughout the year, the college has tirelessly maintained its academic
                                learning, its cultural moorings and its community outreach. During these trying times,
                                it has strived to uphold the quality of education through the adoption of online
                                platforms and creating repositories of virtual knowledge by the stellar efforts of its

                                platform, VideoMeet for the smooth and effective conduction of online classes. Faculty

                                becomes one`s altitude and when a person focuses on success, it becomes one`s habit with
                                gradual passage of time and ultimately habits define a personality and we believe in the
                                making of immaculate personalities who ultimately become the backbones of the society.
                                Higher education plays a magnanimous role in the role definition of the human beings and
                                it is like a foundation for the construction of a good building. We at Subodh strongly
                                believe that every student is a good learner with his or her own set of abilities and
                                virtues and it depends on the pathfinders how they try their level best to find the best
                                of paths for the future torch-bearers. We have been imparting comprehensive education to
                                students for more than six decades to establish a global competence among students and
                                to instill a new kind of zeal and zest which may give wings to their imagination so as
                                to make them creative intellectuals. We frayed into education with a goal to impart
                                quality education and to provide the students with the state-of-the-art facilities and
                                we feel elated to state that we are successfully running on this path till date.
                                Our institution has done really well over the years and has marked its perfect presence
                                in the form of widespread recognition from NAAC with highest CGPA (3.82) across India,

                                and we try to brush up their skills time on and off so that they soar high to
                                excellence. Shaping the career of a student is equal to shaping the future of a country
                                and we do it religiously so that we can contribute in the best possible manner in both.

                            <div class="blog-slider__text">The vision of Subodh College is based on hard work,
                                communication, a strong emphasis on team work and a high level of responsibility. We
                                believe that learning should be based on doing things and not merely knowing things.
                                Learning should relate to real life and motivate the learner to acquire and apply
                                knowledge.Thus, we do not compromise on teaching standards or discipline.The hard work
                                of today is the triumph of the future. The time and effort you invest today will be the
                                deciding factors of your later years.

                                Dream Big, Think Big, Experiment and be Passionate in whatever you do. Challenge
                                yourself and make your identity. We live in a digital age where we do most things at the
                                click of a button. But success doesn’t come this way –it only comes with sheer hard
                                work, dedication, will-power and by pushing yourself out of your comfort zone.

                                This session begins in the middle of an unprecedented situation, a pandemic that has
                                posed so much uncertainty and altered our lives in many ways. We believe that this is
                                the time to not just deal with the current emergency but also build foundations of
                                resilience to face such difficult events in the future. The comfort and health of our
                                student community both mental and physical are given utmost importance. The COVID-19
                                should not lockdown the aspirations of our young generation. These challenges only
                                reinforce our resolve to continue working towards our vision of making our students
                                embrace everything in the wide spectrum of life.

                                The culture of our college is based distinctively on human values, which are reflected
                                in everything we do. We encourage students to demonstrate high levels of commitment and
                                co-operation while all members of staff endeavor to provide maximum opportunities for
                                learning and progression within a secure and safe environment. Our education philosophy
                                is based strongly on partnership where home, college, parish and a wider community work
                                closely together to provide maximum support to the educational process.

                                The show must go on!

                                Ours is a student-centric campus and it lays down a rock solid foundation for young
                                learners to build a heven of knowledge and intellect wherein students are encouraged to
                                uncap their talents and hone their skills. We aim to lend a gentle guiding hand so that
                                our students recognize their inner potential and grow. I invite students to walk through
                                our gates to feel positivity vibrating in the atmosphere and join us in making Subodh
                                College a world class institution.

                                We believe in the multidimensional development of our students which is possible through
                                our serious concern towards both curricular and co-curricular activities. The principle
                                aim of the Institution is academic progress of the weaker and downtrodden sections of
